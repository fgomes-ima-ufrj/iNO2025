Sildenafil has been combined with inhaled nitric oxide to treat pulmonary hypertension. We retrospectively studied the pre- and postoperative effects of oral sildenafil as monotherapy in children with pulmonary hypertension who underwent surgery to correct congenital cardiac defects., From September 2005 through November 2009, 38 children with moderate-to-severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (pulmonary arterial/aortic pressure ratio, >0.7) underwent cardiac surgery at our institution. Fifteen patients were given sildenafil (0.35 mg/kg, every 4 hr) orally or through nasogastric tubes 1 week before and 1 week after surgery. Twenty-three patients of comparable medical status were given sildenafil only upon the institution of cardiopulmonary bypass and for 1 week after surgery., Postoperatively, the 15 patients who were given preoperative sildenafil had significantly lower mean pulmonary arterial pressures (25.6 ± 3.1 vs 30.4 ± 5.7 mmHg; P = 0.005) and pulmonary arterial/aortic pressure ratios (0.35 ± 0.05 vs 0.42 ± 0.07; P = 0.002) than did the other 23 patients. The preoperative therapy also shortened cardiopulmonary bypass time, mechanical ventilation time, and lengths of intensive care unit and hospital stays. No sildenafil-related hypertensive crises or sequelae occurred., As monotherapy, oral sildenafil in low doses appears to control pulmonary hypertension safely and effectively in children undergoing operations to correct congenital heart defects, particularly when it is given both preoperatively and postoperatively.

Material and methods: Data of 147 consecutive patients aged younger than 36 months undergoing cardiac surgery for CHD were reviewed, and they were allocated to two groups based on the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay equal to or less than 7 days (group I, n=114), and more than 7 days (group II, n=33). Results: The patients in group II were significantly younger (10.2&#177;3.9 months vs. 19.9&#177;5.8 months; P<0.001). Aortic cross-clamp times were 39.1&#177;3.6 min in group I, and 50.4&#177;8.7 min in group II (P<0.05). Extubation failures (more than 48 hours) occurred in 3 cases in group I, compared to 29 patients in group II (P<0.0001). A total of 28 patients (7 in group I, and 21 in group II) developed pulmonary complications. These patients contributed to the majority of total ventilator days (69%) as well as ICU stay (58%). Fourteen percent of patients underwent staged operations in group I, compared to 48.5% in group II (P<0.002). Conclusions: Pulmonary complications seem to be one of the most important causes of delayed recovery following cardiac surgery in young children. We suggest that extubation time is a crucial factor for development of pulmonary problems.

A greater risk of genetic aberrations occurrence, including the most common - Down's syndrome, is an unavoidable consequence of this phenomenon. The main determinant of deceased survival in Down syndrome is concomitant congenital heart disease, usually represented by shunt lesions, most commonly atrioventricular canal and ventricular septal defect. Down's syndrome patients are especially prone to develop pulmonary hypertension, related to genetic mutations and abnotrmal endothelial nitric oxide metabolism. Congenital shunt lesions with strong predisposition to pulmonary hypertension development justify performing cardiac surgery in infancy, when the results of surgery are optimal. In children with Down's syndrome postoperative course is usually more complicated and reoperations are common. However, long- and short-term mortality is comparable to that observed in patients with normal karyotype. Contemporary observations reinforce the strategy of surgical referral of patients with Down's syndrome according to generally accepted indications. © 2009 Cornetis.","2009","2025-05-21 20:20:45","2025-05-21 20:20:45","","292-295","","4","11","","","Leczenie wrodzonych wad serca u pacjentów z zespołem Downa","","","","","","","","","","Scopus","","Scopus","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/5HH65QXH/display.html","","","Congenital heart disease; Down's syndrome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

W.","Dynamic changes of endothelin-1, nitric oxide, and cyclic GMP in patients with congenital heart disease","Circulation","","0009-7322","","","BACKGROUND: Pulmonary hypertension causes major morbidity and mortality after congenital heart surgery, but its mechanism remains unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), nitric oxide (NO), and cyclic GMP (cGMP) were assayed at 6 intervals in 50 children undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB): before CPB, 10 minutes into CPB, and 0, 3, 6, and 12 hours after CPB. Three groups based on pulmonary flow and pressure were analyzed: low flow (LF, n=21), high flow/low pressure (systolic pulmonary pressure/systemic pressure ratio, Pp/Ps<50%, HF-LP, n=11), and high flow/high pressure (Pp/Ps> or =50%, HF-HP, n=19). HF-HP and HF-LP received alpha-blockers (chlorpromazine and/or prazosin). HF-HP patients received nitric oxide donors (nitroglycerin/sodium nitroprusside). ET-1 peaked at 6 hours, with its highest level in the HF-HP group (P<.01, by ANOVA). ET-1 correlated significantly with Pp/Ps at 6 hours (r2=.43, P<.005). In the HF-HP group, ET-1 remained above the other groups at 12 hours (12.7+/-2.5 pg/mL versus 6.4+/-1.1 pg/mL versus 6.5+/-3.8 pg/mL P<.05 by ANOVA). NO metabolites were elevated equivalently for the HF-HP and HF-LP groups (5.7+/-2.6 micromol/L versus 0.3.5+/-2.5 micromol/L at 12 hours, P=NS) despite nitric oxide donors and the excess ET-1 in HF-HP patients. Levels of cGMP were similarly elevated in HF-HP and HF-LP patients during this study. CONCLUSIONS: Endogenous NO may decrease vascular tone and maintain low pulmonary pressure in HF-LP patients. High levels of ET-1, inadequate NO production, and/or impaired responses to NO may increase pulmonary pressure in HF-HP patients.","1997-11-04","2025-05-21 20:22:48","2025-05-21 20:22:48","","II-346-351","","9 Suppl","96","","Circulation","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9386122","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9386122","","Female; Humans; Male; Heart Defects, Congenital; Child, Preschool; Infant; Nitric Oxide; Postoperative Complications; Blood Pressure; Cyclic GMP; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Endothelin-1; Hypertension, Pulmonary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pulmonary pressure and resistance were normal in the other 2 children. NO inhalation therapy is indicated for hypoxemia due to reactive pulmonary vasoconstriction, pulmonary hypertensive (PH) crisis, ventilation perfusion mismatch due to prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass, and acceleration of early adaptation to the Fontan circulation. A decrease in heart rate, an increase in mean arterial pressure and a statistical decrease in central venous pressure were observed in all of the 5 children soon after they began to inhale NO, in addition to hemodynamic improvement, probably due to decreased pulmonary vascular resistance, and increased PaO2/FiO2. Although one child died on postoperative day 20 due to a PH crisis rebound upon weaning from the ventilator, the other 4 children experienced improved respiration, circulatory dynamics, and resolution of PH crisis after NO inhalation and were successfully weaned from the ventilator.

After closure of both intracardiac defects recurrent pulmonary hypertensive crises developed and NO inhalation was started with 20 ppm. However, a dose of 5 ppm NO led to an almost maximal decrease in pulmonary artery pressure (- 26%) and pulmonary vascular resistance (- 49%) as well as an increase in cardiac output (+ 37%) and aortic pressure (+ 28%). Moreover, the CO2-responsiveness of the pulmonary vasculature was markedly decreased. After 5 days NO-therapy could be discontinued and the infant was discharged home 35 days later.

Methods: Twenty-three consecutive pediatric patients suffering from severe CHD, such as transposition of great arteries (TGA), Taussing-Bing anomaly, etc, with moderate to severe PH, 15 male and 8 female, aged 7-84 months, with the body weight of 4.5-20.0 kg, pulmonary pressure of 24.0-80.0 mm Hg, and pulmonary resistance of 49.2-1261.9 dyn · s · cm-5 and with different complication such as left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3 cases subpulmonary membrane (1 case), and subaortic membrane (1 case), underwent ASO under general anesthesia and extracorporeal circulation with low temperature (18°C -22°C) and low volume blood flow (50 ml · kg-1 · min-1). The complicated anomalies were corrected simultaneously. Nitric oxide and α-blocker were used to the children with PH during the peri-operational period. Results: Twenty children survived, and were cured and discharged with an obvious improvement of heart function, only one of which had sequel of coma due to cerebral anoxia.

The selective pulmonary vasodilation produced by inhaled nitric oxide (NO) constitutes a fundamental therapeutic advance in the management of this pathology. NO binds immediately with haemoglobin, resulting in its immediate inactivation. This results in perfect maintenance of systemic and coronary blood pressures. A first study performed in 1989 after mitral valve replacement for mitral stenosis with pulmonary hypertension and clinical trials after surgical correction for congenital heart disease and heart transplantation with pulmonary hypertension suggested the efficacy and safety of 20 to 40 ppm NO concentrations in these indications.

"FGECHX8M","journalArticle","2001","Falcone, N.","Pulmonary hypertension in pediatric heart surgery","Revista Espanola De Anestesiologia Y Reanimacion","","0034-9356","","","Congenital heart disease can increase or decrease pulmonary blood flow, pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) or pulmonary artery pressure (PAP). PAP is the product of PVR and pulmonary minute volume (Qp), such that pulmonary hypertension (PHT) may develop as a result of an increase in either PVR or Qp or both. Given that the pulmonary vascular bed is a low pressure system with high flow, any increase in resistance would generate PHT. The normal value of PVR is 2 Woods units (mm Hg/l/min). Increased PAP is due to hypoxic lesions of the endothelium, which release proteolytic enzymes that alter the balance of metabolites of arachidonic acid, regulators of pulmonary vasomotor tone. Hypoxia and acidosis cause intense pulmonary vasoconstriction (hypoxic vasoconstrictor reflex). An increase of PVR is due to a combination of vasoconstrictive processes and remodeling, with hypertrophy of the pulmonary artery. Structural lesions are related to hypertrophy of the endothelium, the transformation of fibroblasts to myocytes and the decrease of the alveolar/arteriolar ratio with the formation of new vessels.PHT may be primary or secondary to another disease. Primary PHT is a rare genetic disease. The most common secondary forms of PHT in pediatrics are due to persistence of neonatal anatomy (neonatal PHT), to heart diseases with left-right shunt (CIV, DAP, etc.), to diseases of the pulmonary parenchyma (interstitial viral infection, mucoviscidosis), and complications of heart surgery. All congenital heart diseases can lead to PHT if not treated promptly. Clinical signs of PHT are highly non-specific: dyspnea, fatigue, syncopes, exercise intolerance, precordialgia, cyanosis and edema. The best approaches to diagnosis and prognosis are echocardiography and cardiac catheterization with vasodilators. Anesthetics that do not alter PVR should be used in such patients, who are sensitive to changes in pulmonary ventilation, to changes in cardiac output and to anesthetics. The treatment of PHT during intra and postoperative pediatric surgery is based on the use of high inspirated oxygen concentration (100%), an adequate sedation and the use of vasodilators (prostaglandin I2, nitric oxide, sodium nitroprusiate and milrinone).","2001-12","2025-05-21 20:42:01","2025-05-21 20:42:21","","462-464","","10","48","","Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim","","","","","","","","spa","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 11792301","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11792301","","Humans; Heart Defects, Congenital; Pulmonary Artery; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Postoperative Complications; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Vasodilator Agents; Infant, Newborn; Anesthetics; Vasoconstriction; Pulmonary Circulation; Cardiac Output; Vascular Resistance; Hypertrophy; Pulmonary Wedge Pressure; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Barbiturates","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study investigated the effects of ulinastatin combined with nitric oxide and prostaglandin E1 (UPN) on pulmonary protection in infants undergoing CPB. Sixty Infants with congenital heart disease, undergoing CPB, were equally divided into five groups. Each group received, respectively, the following treatments: (1) 10000 U.kg(-1) of ulinastatin; (2) Intravenous infusion of 10 ng.kg(-1).min(-1) of PGE1; (3) Inhalation of 20 ppm nitric oxide; (4) Combination of all three agents (UPN); and (5) No treatment group during CPB. Plasma concentrations of sICAM-1, vWF, IL-6, and GMP-140 were measured at 5 time points: before CPB (T1), 30 minutes after the start of CPB (T2), at the end of CPB (T3), and 3 hours (T4) and 24 hours (T5) after termination of CPB. At the same time points, artery blood gas analysis was performed to calculate respiratory index (RI). Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplasin (APTT), and platelet number were also measured in the five groups at 3 hours and 24 hours after surgery, respectively. Postoperative blood loss and blood transfusions were recorded. It was found that the UPN group inhibited plasma levels of sICAM-1, vWF, IL-6, and GMP-140, while decreasing RI. At 3 hours and 24 hours after the operation, PT and APTT levels were significantly shortened and platelet numbers were obviously higher in the UPN group. Cumulative postoperative bleeding was significantly less in the UPN group. This study demonstrated that combination treatment of UPN protected patients from lung injury, decreased plasma vWF, sICAM-1, IL-6, and GMP-140 levels, while inhibiting platelet activation.","2018","2025-05-21 20:56:12","2025-05-21 20:57:28","","13329-13337","","12","11","","International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nitric oxide (NO) added to the CPB oxygenator may reduce systemic inflammation due to CPB and improve recovery from surgery, including improved neurodevelopmental outcomes.                                         Objective               To investigate neurodevelopment, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and factors associated with impaired neurodevelopment at 12 months post surgery in infants who received CPB with NO or standard CPB.                                         Design, Setting, and Participants               This double-masked randomized clinical trial was conducted in 6 centers in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands between July 19, 2017, and April 28, 2021, with a preplanned prospective follow-up 12 months postrandomization completed on August 5, 2022. The cohort included 1364 infants younger than 2 years who underwent open heart surgery with CPB for congenital heart disease.                                         Interventions               The intervention group received NO 20 ppm into the CPB oxygenator. The control group received standard CPB.                                         Main Outcomes and Measures               The primary outcome was neurodevelopment, defined as the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, Third Edition (ASQ-3) total score. Secondary outcomes were HRQOL and functional status as measured by Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and modified Pediatric Overall Performance Category scores, respectively. Sensitivity analyses modeled the outcome for patients lost to follow-up.                                         Results               Of 1318 infants alive 12 months after randomization, follow-up was performed in 927, with 462 patients in the NO group and 465 in the standard care group (median [IQR] age at follow-up, 16.6 [13.7-19.8] months; median [IQR] time since randomization, 12.7 [12.1-13.9] months; 516 male [55.7%]). There were no differences between the NO and standard care groups in ASQ-3 total score (mean [SD], 196.6 [75.4] vs 198.7 [73.8], respectively; adjusted mean difference, −2.24; 95% CI, −11.84 to 7.36). There were no differences in secondary outcomes. Prematurity (gestational age &amp;lt;37 weeks), univentricular lesions, congenital syndromes, and longer intensive care unit length of stay were associated with lower ASQ-3 total scores in adjusted multivariable analyses.                                         Conclusions and Relevance               In this randomized clinical trial of infants with congenital heart disease, NO administered via the CPB oxygenator did not improve neurodevelopmental outcomes or HRQOL 12 months after open heart surgery.

The treat and repair strategy has demonstrated efficacy in adult populations, but there have been no studies on pediatric patients. This study included pediatric patients with PAH and simple congenital heart defects who underwent corrective repair between 2012 and 2021. According to the preoperative treatment strategies, the patients were divided into a regular strategy group (Group 1) and a treat‐and‐repair strategy group (Group 2). Postoperative recovery and follow‐up results were compared between the two groups. A total of 33 patients were included in this study. Group 1 consisted of 19 patients, whereas Group 2 consisted of 14 patients. The pulmonary vascular resistance index in Group 2 was higher than that in Group 1 (10.9 ± 4.1 vs. 8.2 ± 1.6 WU,               p                = 0.031). There were no differences in postoperative recovery between the two groups (               p                > 0.05). During follow‐up, five patients were lost (three in Group 1 and two in Group 2). The median follow‐up period was 59 months. One patient died in Group 1, and two patients died in Group 2. There was no significant difference in the survival curve (               p                = 0.39). At the last follow‐up, another seven patients had experienced a non‐low‐risk condition, with a total of three non‐low‐risk patients in Group 1 and seven in Group 2, including one patient in each group who had a history of ICU admission. According to the ROC curve, a preoperative PVRi <8.2 WU×m               2               can predict postoperative persistent low‐risk state, PVRi <5.2 WU×m               2               can avoid postoperative death and/or ICU administration.

The objective of this study was to follow up children with severe postoperative PH (pulmonary arterial/aortic pressure ratio ≥ 1.0) to evaluate if pulmonary arterial pressure spontaneously normalized or needed PH-targeting therapy and to identify potential high-risk diagnoses for bad outcome. Twenty-five children who developed clinically significant severe PH on at least three occasions postoperatively were included in the follow-up (20–24 years). Data from chart reviews, echocardiographic investigations, and questionnaires were obtained. Three children died within the first year after surgery. Three children were lost to follow-up. The remaining 17 children normalized their pulmonary arterial pressure without the use of PH-targeting drugs at any time during the follow-up. Two children had a remaining mild PH with moderate mitral valve insufficiency. All three children with bad outcome had combined cardiac lesions causing post-capillary pulmonary hypertension. Normalization of the pulmonary arterial pressure occurred in almost all children with severe postoperative PH, without any need of supplemental PH-targeting therapies. All children with bad outcome had diagnoses conformable with post-capillary PH making the use of PH-targeting therapies relatively contraindicated. These data emphasize the need to perform randomized, blinded trials on the use of PH-targeting drugs in children with postoperative PH before accepting it as an indication for routine treatment.","2022-04","2025-05-21 21:06:54","2025-05-21 21:06:54","2025-05-21 21:06:54","827-836","","4","43","","Pediatr Cardiol","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/8T9HJJHH/Lindberg - 2022 - Long-Term Follow-Up of Pediatric Patients with Severe Postoperative Pulmonary Hypertension After Cor.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Among the preoperative advances are improvement in the management of patients with single ventricle equivalents, prenatal diagnosis, and interventional procedures. Intraoperative advances include better understanding of the inflammatory process caused by cardiopulmonary bypass and ways to manage it, newer techniques for treating hypoplastic left heart syndrome and aortic valve disease, and primary repair of complex lesions. Postoperative refinements in managing pulmonary hypertension, low cardiac output state, and ventricular assist devices have decreased surgical mortality and morbidity. Although his primary interest has been adult cardiac surgery, Dr. Geha has contributed directly and indirectly to these advances.","2008-03","2025-05-21 21:06:57","2025-05-21 21:06:57","2025-05-21 21:06:57","340-345","","3","32","","World j. surg.","","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We also evaluated some of the mechanisms of vasodilation under these circumstances by investigating the levels of cyclic GMP and AMP in the pulmonary venous blood. A significant decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance was observed after the administration of nitric oxide (−37 ± 6%, p<0.01), and more intense decrease was observed after the combined administration of nitric oxide and beraprost sodium (−46 ± 6%, p<0.05). In addition, the ratio of pulmonary-to-systemic resistance also decreased to a greater extent with combined administration than with nitric oxide alone (−34 ± 6% vs −42 ± 7%, p<0.05). Conversely, systemic vascular resistance showed no change, neither after loading with nitric oxide nor after combined administration. Although equivalent increases in levels of cyclic GMP were observed after inhalation of nitric and the combined administration (mean 78% vs 65%), greater increases in levels of cyclic AMP were observed with the combined use (mean 15% vs 69%). Combined treatment with nitric oxide and beraprost sodium may prove markedly beneficial in patients with primary and postoperative pulmonary hypertension who do not respond adequately to inhalation of nitric oxide alone or conventional modes of treatment.","1997-10","2025-05-21 21:09:04","2025-05-21 21:09:04","2025-05-21 21:09:04","362-369","","4","7","","Cardiol Young","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In patients of these ages, functional aspects, such as an imbalance between vasoconstricting and vasodilating mechanisms, and morphological alterations of the vessel wall, contribute to the pulmonary hypertension. In the past decades, strategies have emerged for treatment that are targeted at the pathophysiological basis. Thus, in patients with left-to-right shunting and pulmonary hypertension after intra-cardiac repair, treatment with nitric oxide has been introduced effectively, while treatment with prostanoids, such as iloprost, is under investigation. In patients with pulmonary hypertension and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, therapeutic strategies focus on the underlying chronic lung disease and use of vasodilators. The pathogenesis of primary pulmonary hypertension in children remains as yet unclear, although treatment with prostanoids has proven effectively to improve the long-term prognosis.","2003-06","2025-05-21 21:09:06","2025-05-21 21:09:06","2025-05-21 21:09:06","219-227","","3","13","","Cardiol Young","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We studied the correlation between the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene and pulmonary hypertension in children with congenital cardiac diseases.                                         Methods and results               A total of 80 children with congenital cardiac diseases at a median age of 3.8 years, ranged 0.1–36.2 years, and 136 controls were enrolled. Most patients presented with significant left-to-right shunt – pulmonary-to-systemic blood flow of 2.8, with a range from 0.6 to 7.5. In all, 40 out of 80 children showed pulmonary hypertension with mean pressure of 42, ranged 26–82, millimetres of mercury. Thirty-one out of 40 children underwent intra-cardiac repair and 15 out of 31 operated patients were found to have an acute elevation of pulmonary artery pressure after cardiopulmonary bypass. The Glu298Asp polymorphism was identified using polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism. Both in patients and in controls, the genotype distribution corresponded to the Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium. The gene frequency for Glu298Glu, Glu298Asp and Asp298Asp was not different in the control group compared to the patients (Armitage trend test: p = 0.37). The endothelial nitric oxide synthase polymorphism was related to acute post-operative elevation of pulmonary artery pressure (genotypic frequency 53.3 versus 25%; Armitage trend test: p = 0.038). In addition, the allelic frequency of the Glu298Asp was related to post-operative pulmonary hypertension (Fischer’s exact test: p = 0.048). The positive predictive value was 71.43%.                                         Conclusion               Patients with left-to-right shunt are more likely to develop acute elevation of pulmonary artery pressure after cardiopulmonary bypass when presenting with the Glu298Asp polymorphism of the gene endothelial nitric oxide synthase. This could be used as a genetic marker for the predisposition for the development of pulmonary hypertension after intra-cardiac repair.","2011-04","2025-05-21 21:09:21","2025-05-21 21:09:21","2025-05-21 21:09:21","161-169","","2","21","","Cardiol Young","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a systematic review and meta-analyses to determine the effect of inhaled nitric oxide on haemodynamics, gas exchange, and hospitalisation characteristics in children immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass.                                         Materials and methods:               A systematic review of the literature was performed to identify full-text manuscripts in English. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane databases were queried. Once manuscripts were identified for inclusion, a list of all the endpoints in each manuscript was created. Endpoints with data present from two or more studies were then kept for pooled analyses. All endpoints included were continuous variables and so mean and standard deviation were utilised as the effect data for comparison.                                         Results:               A total of eight studies were deemed appropriate for inclusion. There were significant differences with decreases in mean pulmonary artery pressure of −6.82 mmHg, left atrial pressure of −1.16 mmHg, arteriovenous oxygen difference of −1.63, arterial carbon dioxide concentration of −2.41 mmHg, mechanical ventilation duration of −8.56 hours, and length of cardiac ICU stay duration of −0.91 days. All significant variables achieved p < 0.001.                                         Conclusion:               Inhaled nitric oxide in children immediately after cardiopulmonary bypass decreases mean pulmonary artery pressure significantly and decreases the arterial carbon dioxide concentration significantly without significantly altering other haemodynamic parameters. This results in a statistically shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and cardiac ICU length of stay without altering overall hospital length of stay.","2020-08","2025-05-21 21:09:23","2025-05-21 21:09:23","2025-05-21 21:09:23","1151-1156","","8","30","","Cardiol Young","","","","","","","","en","https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pulmonary vasodilator therapies are commonly used post-operatively, but the optimal target patient population, therapy choice, timing of therapy initiation, and duration of therapy are not well defined.                                         Methods:               We used PubMed and EMBASE to identify studies from 2000 to 2020 investigating the use of pulmonary vasodilator therapy post-cardiopulmonary bypass in children aged 0–18 years. To ensure eligibility criteria, studies were systematically reviewed by two independent reviewers.                                         Results:               We identified 26 studies of 42,971 children across four medication classes; 23 were single centre, 14 were prospective, and 11 involved randomisation (four of which employed a placebo-control arm). A disproportionate number of children were from a single retrospective study of 41,872 patients. Definitions varied, but change in pulmonary haemodynamics was the most common primary outcome, used in 14 studies. Six studies had clinical endpoints, with mortality the primary endpoint for two studies. Treatment with inhaled nitric oxide, iloprost, and sildenafil all resulted in improved haemodynamics in specific cohorts of children with post-operative pulmonary hypertension, although improved outcomes were not consistently demonstrated across all treated children. Iloprost may be a cheaper alternative to inhaled nitric oxide with similar haemodynamic response.                                         Conclusion:               Studies were predominantly single-centre, a control arm was rarely used in randomised studies, and haemodynamic endpoints varied significantly.

Apart from difficult weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, PH can often compound weaning from mechanical ventilation in this postoperative subset. From pathophysiological standpoint, the former can be attributed to concurrent detrimental cardiopulmonary consequences of PH as a multisystemic syndrome. Therefore, with an objective to address the affected systems, that is, cardiac and pulmonary simultaneously, we report combined use of inhaled milrinone (a pulmonary vasodilator) through high-frequency nasal cannula (oxygen reservoir and continuous positive airway pressure delivery device), purported to complement each other's mechanism of action in the management of PH, thereby hastening postoperative recovery. This article additionally presents a nuanced perspective on the advantages of combining the aforementioned therapies and hence proposing the same as a possible “postoperative cardiopulmonary elixir.”","2022-07","2025-05-21 21:09:45","2025-05-21 21:09:45","2025-05-21 21:09:45","126-130","","02","06","","Journal of Cardiac Critical Care TSS","Inhaled Milrinone via HFNC as a Postextubation Cardiopulmonary Elixir","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, members of the Congenital Heart Disease and Pediatric Task Forces of the Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute decided to conduct a survey aimed at collecting expert opinion from different institutions in several countries, covering many aspects of the management of PAH‐CHD, from clinical recognition to noninvasive and invasive diagnostic procedures and immediate postoperative support. In privileged communities, the vast majority of children with congenital cardiac shunts are now treated early in life, on the basis of noninvasive diagnostic evaluation, and have an uneventful postoperative course, with no residual PAH. However, a small percentage of patients (older at presentation, with extracardiac syndromes or absence of clinical features of increased pulmonary blood flow, thus suggesting elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) remain at a higher risk of complications and unfavorable outcomes. These patients need a more sophisticated diagnostic approach, including invasive procedures. The authors emphasize that decision making regarding operability is based not only on cardiac catheterization data but also on the complete diagnostic picture, which includes the clinical history, physical examination, and all aspects of noninvasive evaluation.","2014-06","2025-05-21 21:10:12","2025-05-21 21:10:12","2025-05-21 21:10:12","330-341","","2","4","","Pulm. circ.","Repair of Congenital Heart Disease with Associated Pulmonary Hypertension in Children","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/XQPYYISJ/Lopes et al. - 2014 - Repair of Congenital Heart Disease with Associated Pulmonary Hypertension in Children What are the.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to susceptibility for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients with Down syndrome, repair is usually aimed for no later than 6 months of life. However, with rising immigration from developing countries to Europe, more patients with unrepaired CHD are diagnosed at a later age. Anatomical repair may be precluded, when advanced pulmonary vascular disease has been established.                                         Case summary               We report a 39-month-old male patient with Down syndrome with a large non-restrictive perimembranous ventricular septal defect, a large patent ductus arteriosus, and a secundum-type atrial septal defect with a prominent left-to-right shunting. Haemodynamic assessment revealed only a mild increase of pulmonary artery pressures (mPAP) with low pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRi). Vasodilator testing led to a further increase of the left-to-right shunt and decrease of PVRi, suggesting operability. After careful consideration, the patient underwent complete surgical repair with a good post-operative clinical outcome. Cardiac catheterization 6 months after corrective repair showed a normal mPAP. No signs of PAH have been detected in the medium-term follow-up.                                         Discussion               Expertise, increased physician awareness, and a thorough pre-operative multidisciplinary evaluation are paramount to determine the best treatment approach for patients, who may present late with multiple shunts, and—in our case—underlying Down syndrome. Long-term close post-surgical follow-up in an expert centre is warranted to promptly diagnose and treat a possible late presentation of PAH appropriately.","2021-07-01","2025-05-21 21:10:20","2025-05-21 21:10:20","2025-05-21 21:10:20","ytab234","","7","5","","","Against all odds—late repair of multiple shunt lesions in a patient with Down syndrome","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","Egorova, Anastasia; Voges, Inga; Ahmed, A Shaheer; Mukherjee, Rahul; Mehta, Vishal Shahil","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there are still no treatment guidelines or expert consensus on the standard treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crisis, and the effect of conventional treatment is still unsatisfactory. We present a case of a patient who developed pulmonary hypertensive crisis after cardiac surgery, and was successfully rescued with a pioneering method, which has never been reported so far.                                         Case summary               An infant with congenital heart disease had undergone cardiac surgery successfully. Due to obvious myocardial oedema, sternal closure was delayed. The left atrial and right ventricular pressure monitoring tubes, both of which were connected through a triplet, were inserted into right pulmonary vein and pulmonary artery, respectively, and the triplet was in closed condition. On the night of the surgery, pulmonary hypertensive crisis occurred. Emergency bedside thoracotomy was given, and the triplet was turned on urgently to make the left atrial and right ventricular pressure monitoring tubes connected. Meantime, conventional treatment was performed. Eventually, the pulmonary hypertensive crisis was quickly relieved, and the infant was discharged 9 days later.                                         Discussion               The left atrial and right ventricular pressure monitoring tubes are placed intraoperatively in patients who both need delayed sternal closure and have high risk factors for pulmonary hypertensive crisis, by which could not only monitor the pressure of left atrium and right ventricle in real time but also effectively relieve the right ventricular pressure instantaneously when pulmonary hypertensive crisis occurs, as well as remedy ischaemia of systemic and coronary circulation.","2023-11-02","2025-05-21 21:10:23","2025-05-21 21:10:23","2025-05-21 21:10:23","ytad527","","11","7","","","A 1-month-old infant with pulmonary hypertensive crisis after cardiac surgery was successfully rescued with connection of left atrial and right ventricular pressure measurement tubes","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","Singh, Arvind; Wong, Ivan; Zancanaro, Edoardo; Kadioglu, Hikmet","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The physiological sequelae (pulmonary hypertension and elevated pulmonary vascular resistance) can overwhelm the right ventricle and lead to circulatory collapse. Despite the common end-point, the preceding pathophysiology is complex and variable and requires a tailored approach to diagnosis and management. In this article, we will review the most recent evidence and explore an approach to current controversies in the diagnosis and management of common or challenging patient subgroups.                                         Recent findings               New methods of interpreting data derived from echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may assist in risk stratification and response to therapy. In specific patient subgroups, standard pharmacological therapies to reduce right ventricle afterload may be overutilized, ineffective and in some cases harmful. In the patient failing pharmacological therapy, new and novel techniques are being explored including temporary extracorporeal mechanical circulatory support, pumpless lung assist devices and novel surgical and catheterization procedures.                                         Summary               PVD is a diverse entity, and attention to the underlying pathophysiology is essential for appropriate management. Despite significant advances in our understanding, the majority of data comes from small uncontrolled studies and must be interpreted with caution.","2018-06","2025-05-21 21:10:53","2025-05-21 21:10:53","2025-05-21 21:10:53","326-331","","3","30","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction of the systemic vasculature has never been quantified in this setting. The objective of the present study was to quantify acute effects of cardiopulmonary bypass on endothelial vasomotor control and attempt to correlate these effects with postoperative cytokines, tissue edema, and clinical outcomes in infants.                                         Design:               Single-center prospective observational cohort pilot study.                                         Setting:               Pediatric cardiac ICU at a tertiary children’s hospital.                                         Patients:               Children less than 1 year old requiring cardiopulmonary bypass for repair of a congenital heart lesion.                                         Intervention:               None.                                         Measurements and Main Results:                                Laser Doppler perfusion monitoring was coupled with local iontophoresis of acetylcholine (endothelium-dependent vasodilator) or sodium nitroprusside (endothelium-independent vasodilator) to quantify endothelial-dependent vasomotor function in the cutaneous microcirculation. Measurements were obtained preoperatively, 2–4 hours, and 24 hours after separation from cardiopulmonary bypass. Fifteen patients completed all laser Doppler perfusion monitor (Perimed, Järfälla, Sweden) measurements. Comparing prebypass with 2–4 hours postbypass responses, there was a decrease in both peak perfusion (                 p                 = 0.0006) and area under the dose-response curve (                 p                 = 0.005) following acetylcholine, but no change in responses to sodium nitroprusside. Twenty-four hours after bypass responsiveness to acetylcholine improved, but typically remained depressed from baseline. Conserved endothelial function was associated with higher urine output during the first 48 postoperative hours (                 R                 2                 = 0.43;                 p                 = 0.008).                                                        Conclusions:               Cutaneous endothelial dysfunction is present in infants immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass and recovers significantly in some patients within 24 hours postoperatively. Confirmation of an association between persistent endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction and decreased urine output could have important clinical implications. Ongoing research will explore the pattern of endothelial-dependent vasomotor dysfunction after cardiopulmonary bypass and its relationship with biochemical markers of inflammation and clinical outcomes.","2020-01","2025-05-21 21:10:57","2025-05-21 21:10:57","2025-05-21 21:10:57","42-49","","1","21","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SETTING:               PICU and cardiac ICUs in seven Collaborative Pediatric Critical Care Research Network hospitals.                                         PATIENTS:               Consecutive patients, less than 18 years old, mechanically ventilated before or within 24 hours of iNO initiation. iNO was started for a cardiac indication and excluded newborns with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, meconium aspiration syndrome, and persistent pulmonary hypertension, or when iNO started at an outside institution.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:                                Four-hundred seven patients with iNO initiation based on cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac dysfunction patients were administered iNO for a median of 4 days (2–7 d). There was significant morbidity with 51 of 407 (13%) requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and 27 of 407 (7%) requiring renal replacement therapy after iNO initiation, and a 28-day mortality of 46 of 407 (11%). Of the 366 (90%) survivors, 64 of 366 patients (17%) had new morbidity as assessed by Functional Status Scale. Among the postoperative cardiac surgical group (                 n                 = 301), 37 of 301 (12%) had a superior cavopulmonary connection and nine of 301 (3%) had a Fontan procedure. Based on echocardiographic variables prior to iNO (                 n                 = 160) in the postoperative surgical group, right ventricle dysfunction was associated with 28-day and hospital mortalities (both,                 p                 < 0.001) and ventilator-free days (                 p                 = 0.003); tricuspid valve regurgitation was only associated with ventilator-free days (                 p                 < 0.001), whereas pulmonary hypertension was not associated with mortality or ventilator-free days.                                                        CONCLUSIONS:               Pediatric patients in whom iNO was initiated for a cardiac indication had a high mortality rate and significant morbidity.

Results:                One hundred and three patients (25%) were still intubated after 61 h; 38 patients required LMV and they occupied 33% of total intensive care unit (ICU) bed days.

Primary rather than palliative surgical repair of cardiac lesions has been preferred in recent years. However, LBW remains a risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity after open‐heart surgery (OHS). There is a paucity of information about the anesthetic challenges presented by LBW infants undergoing OHS. This review summarizes the perioperative issues of relevance to anesthesiologists who manage these high‐risk patients. Emphasis is placed on management concerns that are unique to LBW infants.

Preoperative echocardiography showed evidence of pulmonary hypertension. The post operative course was complicated failure to wean from ventilatory and inotropic support. Echocardiography showed severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and suggested some fistulous drainage of the left coronary artery into the right pulmonary artery; this anomalous drainage of the left coronary artery into the right pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) was confirmed with coronary angiogram. Re‐implantation of the left coronary artery into the aorta was performed. Extra‐corporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was required to allow time for ventricular recovery. Supports were weaned gradually, with concurrent evidence of LV recovery and the child was discharged on postoperative day 30. ALCAPA is rare and typically presents at 8 weeks of age with symptoms of heart failure, as pulmonary pressure falls leading to myocardial ischaemia due to myocardial hypoperfusion with relatively desaturated blood. In our case the pulmonary hypertension and left to right shunt preoperatively were protective, maintaining forward flow of relatively oxygenated blood. While protective to the myocardium this made the preoperative diagnosis of ALCAPA difficult, as there was no flow reversal on Doppler echocardiography. Closure of the septal defects meant this protective effect was lost, with subsequent severe myocardial ischaemia and heart failure. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges of ALCAPA, the ‘protective’ effects of pulmonary hypertension with ALCAPA, and the importance of early cardiac catheterization in the setting of unexplained failure to wean post cardiac surgery.","2012-05","2025-05-21 21:11:13","2025-05-21 21:11:13","2025-05-21 21:11:13","487-489","","5","22","","Pediatric Anesthesia","What other anomalies?","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase type 3 (PDE3) inhibitor, can also reduce PVR for postoperative patients with pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesized that iNO, in conjunction with milrinone, can provide additive benefits for pulmonary hemodynamics and reduce the occurrence of iNO withdrawal failure/rebound. Thirty‐one patients with marked elevation of transpulmonary pressure gradient (TPG, >10 mm Hg) or central venous pressure (CVP, >15 mm Hg) after modified fenestrated Fontan operation were prospectively randomized into two groups, that is, group iNO (iNO at ∼10 ppm,               n                = 15) and group iNO + Mil (iNO at ∼10 ppm and milrinone at 0.5 µg/kg/min,               n                = 16).

Few studies have examined the roles of               CRELD1               and               GATA4               in cardiac abnormalities or their association with pulmonary artery histopathology. Children with               DS               have an elevated risk of pulmonary arterial hypertension (               PAH               ). This increased risk is likely mainly due to genetic background, the structural characteristics of the pulmonary vascular wall, and certain heart diseases and partly due to pulmonary hypoplasia, upper and lower airway obstructive diseases, chronic infection, and neuromuscular underdevelopment. Exposure to increased left‐to‐right shunt flow increases sheer stress on endothelium and may induce endothelial dysfunction followed by irreversible remodeling of pulmonary arteries. Pathologic changes include endothelial cell proliferation and thickening of the pulmonary arterial wall due to mechanical responses to the thinner medial smooth muscle cell layer, which includes underdevelopment of alveoli. Production of prostacyclin and nitric oxide is diminished in               DS               , but endothelin‐1 and thromboxane are elevated. Perioperatively, patients with               DS               may experience pulmonary hypertensive crisis after intracardiac repair and prolonged               PAH               , and have a poorer response to nitric oxide inhalation. To better manage               DS               , it is crucial to systematically evaluate the systemic complications of               DS               . Cardiac catheterization data, particularly those regarding pulmonary arterial resistance, are essential in assessing severity and response to vasodilating agents, preventing postoperative crisis, and evaluating the possibility of intracardiac repair. Advanced therapy with pulmonary vasodilating agents appears effective. Operative risk is similar for individuals with and without               DS               , except among patients with a complete atrioventricular canal defect.","2014-06","2025-05-21 21:11:22","2025-05-21 21:11:22","2025-05-21 21:11:22","297-303","","3","56","","Pediatrics International","Clinical characteristics of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with <span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/SS7EC2KK/Saji - 2014 - Clinical characteristics of pulmonary arterial hypertension associated with span style=font-varian.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many infants with CHD require corrective surgery with most operations requiring cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). CPB triggers a systemic inflammatory response which is associated with low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), postoperative morbidity and mortality. Delivery of nitric oxide (NO) into CPB circuits can provide myocardial protection and reduce bypass-induced inflammation, leading to less LCOS and improved recovery. We hypothesised that using NO during CPB increases ventilator-free days (VFD) (the number of days patients spend alive and free from invasive mechanical ventilation up until day 28) compared with standard care. Here, we describe the NITRIC trial protocol.                                         Methods and analysis               The NITRIC trial is a randomised, double-blind, controlled, parallel-group, two-sided superiority trial to be conducted in six paediatric cardiac surgical centres. One thousand three-hundred and twenty infants <2 years of age undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB will be randomly assigned to NO at 20 ppm administered into the CPB oxygenator for the duration of CPB or standard care (no NO) in a 1:1 ratio with stratification by age (<6 and ≥6 weeks), single ventricle physiology (Y/N) and study centre. The primary outcome will be VFD to day 28. Secondary outcomes include a composite of LCOS, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or death within 28 days of surgery; length of stay in intensive care and in hospital; and, healthcare costs. Analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. Preplanned secondary analyses will investigate the impact of NO on host inflammatory profiles postsurgery.                                         Ethics and dissemination               The study has ethical approval (HREC/17/QRCH/43, dated 26 April 2017), is registered in the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12617000821392) and commenced recruitment in July 2017.

This pre-operative dynamic pulmonary hypertension can be superimposed and aggravated by acute post-operative PH or persist as chronic PH, especially in children who are not operated on early enough. Inhaled iloprost, a stable prostacyclin analogue, is used for the post-operative management of PH in infants and children with CHD. In a prospective open-label proof-of-concept study, the efficacies of inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) and inhaled iloprost were directly compared. Primary endpoints were the occurrence of a major or minor pulmonary hypertensive crisis. No significant difference between the effects of iNO versus iloprost on peri-operative PH was observed. Neither substance on its own prevented pulmonary hypertensive crises in high-risk infants, so a combination of both substances should be tested in future trials. In China, there are more than 4 million untreated CHD patients. More than 50% of them are untreated adults. Acute pulmonary vasoreactivity tests were performed in CHD patients between 9 months and 43 years of age using inhaled iloprost, in order to find out whether a pre-operative response to inhaled iloprost is a good predictor for the post-operative performance of these patients. The results showed that patient selection criteria for surgery should include both a 20% reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) index after iloprost inhalation and a resulting PVR index <11 Wood U/m<sup>2</sup>. CHD children between 14 days and 11 years of age took part in a placebo-controlled pilot study that investigated the role of aerosolized iloprost in the treatment of PH after corrective surgery. They received either low- or high-dose iloprost or placebo. Inhaled iloprost significantly improved haemodynamics in a dose-dependent manner and prevented reactive PH and pulmonary hypertensive crises in most of these mechanically ventilated children after CHD repair.","2010","2025-05-21 21:11:50","2025-05-21 21:11:50","2025-05-21 21:11:50","10-17","","1","116","","Cardiology","Peri-Operative Pulmonary Hypertension in Paediatric Patients","","","","","","","en","https://www.karger.com/Services/SiteLicenses","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In other forms of pulmonary vascular disease with increased PVR, an elevated activity of a phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE-5), responsible for the degradation of cyclic guanidine monophosphate (cGMP), the second messenger of endothelially produced NO, has been demonstrated. This study compares the effects of inhaled NO before and after the specific inhibition of the PDE-5 by intravenous sildenafil (Viagra™) in pre- and postoperative children with increased PVR because of CHD.                                                          Methods and Results—                              12 children with congenital heart disease (age 0.2 to 15.7 years, median 2.4 years) and increased mean pulmonary arterial pressure, and 12 postoperative children (age 0.11 to 0.65 years, median 0.32 years) with increased PVR (8.3±1.0 Wood Units*m               2               ) were studied during cardiac catheterization (“cath laboratory”), or within 2 hours after return from cardiac surgery (“post op”), respectively. All were sedated, tracheally intubated and paralyzed. During alveolar hyperoxygenation (F               i               O               2               =0.65), the effects of inhaled NO (20 ppm) were compared before and after the stepwise infusion of sildenafil (“cath laboratory”, 1 mg/kg; post op, 0.25 mg/kg). Intravenous sildenafil more effectively reduced PVR than NO (11.5% versus 4.3% in the “cath laboratory” patient group,               P               <0.05, and 25.8% versus 14.6% in the post op patient group,               P               =0.09. The increase in cGMP in response to NO was potentiated (2- to 2.4-fold) by PDE-5 inhibition. While the vasodilating effects of sildenafil showed pulmonary selectivity, its infusion was associated with increased intrapulmonary shunting in the postoperative patients (Q               s               /Q               t               =16.5±4.7% to 25.5±18.2%               P               =0.04).                                                          Conclusions—                              Intravenous sildenafil is as effective as inhaled NO as a pulmonary vasodilator in children with congenital heart disease.

Methods and Results               —Ten patients (aged 0.62±0.27 years) with pulmonary hypertension undergoing cardiac catheterization who had not had surgery and 10 patients (aged 0.65±0.73 years) who had recently undergone cardiopulmonary bypass were examined. All were sedated and paralyzed and received positive-pressure ventilation. Blood samples and pressure measurements were taken from catheters in the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein or left atrium. Respiratory mass spectrometry was used to measure oxygen uptake, and cardiac output was determined by the direct Fick method. PVR was calculated during steady state at ventilation with room air, during F               io               2               of 0.65, then during additional intravenous infusion of L-Arg (15 mg · kg               −1               · min               −1               ) and Sub-P (1 pmol · kg               −1               · min               −1               ), and finally during inhalation of NO (20 ppm). In preoperative patients, the lack of an additional significant change of PVR with L-Arg, Sub-P, and inhaled NO suggests little preexisting PED. Postoperative PVR was higher, with an additional pulmonary endothelial contribution that was restorable with L-Arg and Sub-P.                                         Conclusions               —Postoperatively, the rise in PVR suggested PED, which was restorable by L-Arg and Sub-P, with no additional effect of inhaled NO. These results may indicate important new treatment strategies for these patients.","1999-08-17","2025-05-21 21:11:56","2025-05-22 11:30:04","2025-05-21 21:11:56","749-755","","7","100","","Circulation","<span style=""font-variant","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/LNETX9CH/Schulze-Neick et al. - 1999 - l -Arginine and Substance P Reverse the Pulmonary Endo.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigated whether CPB is responsible for pulmonary endothelial dysfunction and contributes to postoperative pulmonary hypertension.                                         METHODS AND RESULTS               We infused the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (ACH) into the pulmonary circulation of pulmonary hypertensive children with congenital heart disease either before (n = 12) or after (n = 22) surgical repair on CPB. The dose response to ACH (10(-9) to 10(-6) M) was recorded for all hemodynamic variables. Nine additional postoperative patients were studied with ACH followed by inhalation of 80 ppm nitric oxide, an endothelium-independent smooth muscle relaxant. Plasma levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP) were measured before and after ACH and nitric oxide administration. Pulmonary vasodilation with 10(-6) M ACH was seen in all preoperative patients but was markedly attenuated in postoperative patients. Baseline pulmonary vascular resistance (5.6 +/- 1.0 U x m2) fell 46 +/- 5% in preoperative patients but declined only 11 +/- 4% from baseline (5.8 +/- 0.9 U x m2) in postoperative patients (P < .002). However, inhalation of 80 ppm nitric oxide after ACH infusion in postoperative patients lowered pulmonary vascular resistance by 33 +/- 4% (P < .0002 compared with postoperative ACH response) with minimal effects on the systemic circulation. This finding suggests that the capacity for smooth muscle relaxation and pulmonary vasodilation was present in postoperative patients but could not be induced by ACH. Plasma levels of cGMP in postoperative patients were unchanged after acetylcholine infusion but rose more than threefold during pulmonary vasodilation with nitric oxide (P < .0001). This finding is consistent with the purported role of cGMP as the second messenger effecting smooth muscle relaxation in this process.                                         CONCLUSIONS               CPB may be responsible for postoperative dysfunction of the pulmonary endothelial cell and may contribute to postoperative pulmonary hypertension in children. Inhaled nitric oxide is a potent pulmonary vasodilator after CPB with minimal systemic circulatory effects. It may have important diagnostic and therapeutic applications in patients with congenital heart disease.","1993-11","2025-05-21 21:12:00","2025-05-21 21:12:00","2025-05-21 21:12:00","2128-2138","","5","88","","Circulation","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilators, such as inhaled epoprostenol (iEPO) and nitric oxide (iNO), are essential therapeutics for the prevention and medical management of postoperative RVF. However, there is limited evidence from clinical trials to guide agent selection despite the significant cost considerations of iNO therapy.                                         METHODS:               In this double-blind trial, participants were stratified by assigned surgery and key preoperative prognostic features, then randomized to continuously receive either iEPO or iNO beginning at the time of separation from cardiopulmonary bypass with the continuation of treatment into the intensive care unit stay. The primary outcome was the composite RVF rate after both operations, defined after transplantation by the initiation of mechanical circulatory support for isolated RVF, and defined after left ventricular assist device implantation by moderate or severe right heart failure according to criteria from the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support. An equivalence margin of 15 percentage points was prespecified for between-group RVF risk difference. Secondary postoperative outcomes were assessed for treatment differences and included: mechanical ventilation duration; hospital and intensive care unit length of stay during the index hospitalization; acute kidney injury development including renal replacement therapy initiation; and death at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year after surgery.                                         RESULTS:               Of 231 randomized participants who met eligibility at the time of surgery, 120 received iEPO, and 111 received iNO. Primary outcome occurred in 30 participants (25.0%) in the iEPO group and 25 participants (22.5%) in the iNO group, for a risk difference of 2.5 percentage points (two one-sided test 90% CI, –6.6% to 11.6%) in support of equivalence. There were no significant between-group differences for any of the measured postoperative secondary outcomes.                                         CONCLUSIONS:               Among patients undergoing major cardiac surgery for advanced heart failure, inhaled pulmonary-selective vasodilator treatment using iEPO was associated with similar risks for RVF development and development of other postoperative secondary outcomes compared with treatment using iNO.

Inhaled nitric oxide is an effective treatment option, but rebound pulmonary hypertension can occur upon its withdrawal. Sildenafil may facilitate its withdrawal by restoring cyclic guanosine monophosphate availability via phosphodiesterase-5 inhibition. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of sildenafil in facilitating weaning from inhaled nitric oxide after congenital cardiac surgery in patients who had previously failed weaning, and to compare the effects of sildenafil on pulmonary and systemic hemodynamics. Children who received sildenafil after cardiovascular surgery during a 23-month period at Riley Hospital for Children were identified. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed to determine sildenafil and nitric oxide dosing, pulmonary and systemic blood pressures, and adverse effects. Oral sildenafil was administered to 7 children who had failed attempts at inhaled nitric oxide weaning. Inhaled nitric oxide was weaned from 29.8 ± 5.9 ppm prior to sildenafil initiation to 12.2 ± 3.4 ppm (mean ± SE; P = .024) in the 24 hours after sildenafil. Mean pulmonary artery and systemic arterial pressure were unchanged from baseline when measured 1 hour after sildenafil dosing (mean pulmonary artery pressure, 29 ± 1 to 27 ± 0.7 mm Hg, P = .066; mean systemic arterial pressure, 56 ± 1.2 to 54 ± 1.2 mm Hg, P = .202).

We examined a single‐center retrospective cohort of children with active or pharmacologically controlled PH who underwent cardiac catheterization or non‐cardiac surgery during 2006–2014. Preoperative characteristics and perioperative courses were examined to determine relationships between the severity or etiology of PH, type of procedure, and occurrence of major and minor events. We identified 77 patients who underwent 148 procedures at a median age of six months. The most common PH etiologies were bronchopulmonary dysplasia (46.7%), congenital heart disease (29.9%), and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (14.3%). Cardiac catheterizations (39.2%), and abdominal (29.1%) and central venous access (8.9%) were the most common procedures. Major events included failed planned extubation (5.6%), postoperative cardiac arrest (4.7%), induction or intraoperative cardiac arrest (2%), and postoperative death (1.4%). Major events were more frequent in patients with severe baseline PH (               P                = 0.006) and the incidence was associated with procedure type (               P                = 0.05).

Some patients have persistently elevated pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) after cardiac surgery, an undesired condition that is difficult to predict. We investigated the value of clinical, hemodynamic, and histopathological data in predicting the outcome in a prospective cohort. Patients with PHT‐CHD received sildenafil orally pre‐ and postoperatively for six months and then were subjected to a catheter study. Thirty‐three patients were enrolled (age range = 4.6–37.0 months). Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 4.9 (range = 3.9–7.2) Wood units × m               2               (median with IQR). Twenty‐two patients had a ≥ 20% decrease in PVR and pulmonary‐to‐systemic vascular resistance ratio (PVR/SVR) in response to inhaled nitric oxide (NO). The response was directly related to the degree of medial hypertrophy of pulmonary arterioles (               P                < 0.05) (morphometric analysis, intraoperative lung biopsy). Subsequently, five of the non‐responders had a ≥ 30% increase in pulmonary blood flow in response to sildenafil (3.0 [2.0–4.0] mg/kg/day). Six months after surgery, PAP and PVR were significantly lower (               P                < 0.001 vs. baseline), even in seven patients with Heath‐Edwards grade III/IV pulmonary vascular lesions (               P                = 0.018), but still abnormal in 12 individuals (>25 mmHg and >3.0 U × m               2               , respectively).

Patients and Methods:               Between August 2010 and May 2013, a total of 1,436 patients were treated for congenital cardiac defects at our institution. Common arterial trunk was treated surgically in seven patients older than one year of age (three males, four females; age: 13 months to 5 years, mean: 2.8 ± 2.04 years). All patients underwent cardiac catheterization in order to determine operability.                                         Results:               All patients had the aortic dominant type of common arterial trunk. The pulmonary vascular resistance and Qp/Qs ratio before and after oxygen inhalation were mean 9.04 + 4.2 (range: 3.8 and 10.7) wood units and 4.67 ± 2.3 (range: 3 and 6.5) wood units and 3.3 + 1.8 (range: 1.42 and 5.3) and 4.98 + 2.2 (range: 4 and 6.2), respectively. All patients underwent elective primary repair. The ventricular septal defect was closed in all patients, five with a nonvalved patch and two with a unidirectional check-valved patch. Early postoperatively, patients were sedated, hyperventilated, and received nitric oxide for a minimum of 24 hours. There was no early or late mortality. The mean length of hospital stay was 9.3 ± 5.7 days, and mean duration of follow-up was 214 ± 59 days.                                         Conclusion:               Complete repair of common arterial trunk in patients older than one year of age is feasible in appropriately selected cases.

Neonates undergoing the Norwood procedure are subject to develop I/R injury due to the immaturity of their organs and the potential need to interrupt or decrease systemic flow during surgery. We hypothesized that NO administration during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) ameliorates the I/R and could help the postoperative recovery after the Norwood procedure.                                         Methods:               Twenty-four neonates who underwent a Norwood procedure were enrolled in a prospective randomized blinded controlled trial to receive NO (12 patients) or placebo (12 patients) into the oxygenator of the CPB circuit during the Norwood procedure. Markers of I/R injury were collected at baseline (T0), after weaning from CPB before modified ultrafiltration (T1), after modified ultrafiltration (T2), and at 12 hours (T3) and 24 hours (T4) after surgery, and they were compared between both groups, as well as other postoperative clinical variables.                                         Results:               There was no difference in age, weight, anatomical diagnosis, CPB, and aortic cross-clamp time between both groups. Troponin levels were lower in the study group at T1 (0.62 ± 58 ng/mL vs 0.87 ± 0.58 ng/mL, P = .31) and became significantly lower at T2 (0.36 ± 0.32 ng/mL vs 0.97 ± 0.48 ng/mL, P = .009).There were no significant differences between both groups for all other markers. Despite a lower troponin level, there was no difference in inotropic scores or ventricular function between both groups.

Design:               An analysis of the cost of epoprostenol and NO use over the previous 18 months was performed. Three 6-month periods were identified, two in which epoprostenol was used and the third in which inhaled NO was introduced for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.                                         Setting:               A 10-bed pediatric cardiac intensive care unit, Royal Liverpool Children's Hospital, Alder Hey, Liverpool, England.                                         Subjects:               Children with congenital heart disease and persistently elevated pulmonary artery pressure following cardiac surgery.                                         Main Outcome Measures:               The total duration of use of epoprostenol and inhaled NO was documented. The costs per hour for epoprostenol and inhaled NO were calculated and the annual cost of each agent was estimated.                                         Results:               In the two 6-month periods prior to the introduction of inhaled NO, epoprostenol was used on 14 occasions (5 in the first period, 3 in the second). In the last 6-month period, nine children required pulmonary vasodilator therapy on 14 occasions. All nine children were treated successfully with inhaled NO; none were given or needed epoprostenol, as NO always was effective in providing pulmonary vasodilatation. For resistant pulmonary hypertension, increasing the concentration of NO would have been the next therapeutic option. The cost for the two 6-month periods using epoprostenol was $19,483.48 for the drug and $283.25 for equipment costs (total cost $19,766.73). There was no expenditure on epoprostenol in the final 6-month period. The cost of NO was $465. However, the total expenditure, including the delivery and monitoring system, was $4,722.85.                                         Conclusions:               Using inhaled NO in our pediatric cardiac intensive care unit abolished the use of epoprostenol during the reported monitoring period. The cost savings were significant, amounting to 12% of the annual drug budget for the unit. The cost of setting up the inhaled NO delivery system is recouped rapidly. The ease of delivery and measurement of inhaled NO also may have contributed to its increased clinical use.","1995-07","2025-05-21 21:12:19","2025-05-21 21:12:19","2025-05-21 21:12:19","163-166","","4","11","","Journal of Pharmacy Technology","","","","","","","","en","https://journals.sagepub.com/page/policies/text-and-data-mining-license","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The objective of this study was to describe the current use of NO in real life and the gap with the guidelines.                                         METHODS:               This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study on inhaled NO administered through an integrated delivery and monitoring device and indicated for PH according to the market authorizations. The characteristics of NO therapy and ventilation modes were observed. Concomitant pulmonary vasodilator treatments, safety data, and outcome were also collected. Quantitative data are expressed as median (25th, 75th percentile).                                         RESULTS:               Over 1 year, 236 patients were included from 14 equipped and trained centers: 117 adults and 81 children with PH associated with cardiac surgery and 38 neonates with persistent PH of the newborn. Inhaled NO was initiated before intensive care unit (ICU) admission in 57%, 12.7%, and 38.9% with an initial dose of 10 (10, 15) ppm, 20 (18, 20) ppm, and 17 (11, 20) ppm, and a median duration of administration of 3.9 (1.9, 6.1) days, 3.8 (1.8, 6.8) days, and 3.1 (1.0, 5.7) days, respectively, for the adult population, pediatric cardiac group, and newborns. The treatment was performed using administration synchronized to the mechanical ventilation. The dose was gradually decreased before withdrawal in 86% of the cases according to the usual procedure of each center. Adverse events included rebound effect for 3.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9%–8.5%) of adults, 1.2% (95% CI, 0.0%–6.7%) of children, and 2.6% (95% CI, 0.1%–13.8%) of neonates and methemoglobinemia exceeded 2.5% for 5 of 62 monitored patients. Other pulmonary vasodilators were associated with NO in 23% of adults, 95% of children, and 23.7% of neonates. ICU stay was respectively 10 (6, 22) days, 7.5 (5.5, 15) days, and 9 (8, 15) days and ICU mortality was 22.2%, 6.2%, and 7.9% for adults, children, and neonates, respectively.                                         CONCLUSIONS:               This study confirms the safety of NO therapy in the 3 populations with a low rate of rebound effect. Gradual withdrawal of NO combined with pulmonary vasodilators are current practices in this population. The use of last-generation NO devices allowed good compliance with recommendations.","2018-04","2025-05-21 21:12:26","2025-05-21 21:12:26","2025-05-21 21:12:26","1234-1240","","4","126","","","New Modalities for the Administration of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Intensive Care Units After Cardiac Surgery or for Neonatal Indications","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/ZWAIEU48/Gaudard et al. - 2018 - New Modalities for the Administration of Inhaled Nitric Oxide in Intensive Care Units After Cardiac.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is an effective but expensive treatment of pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure in patients with congenital or acquired heart disease. Our objective was to implement standardized initiation and weaning guidelines for iNO usage in the cardiothoracic ICU (CTICU) to reduce variation in use while maintaining quality patient care.                                         METHODS:               All CTICU patients who received iNO from January 2011 to December 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. Standardized iNO initiation and weaning guidelines were implemented in January 2012. Variables before and after guideline implementation were compared.                                         RESULTS:               From January to December 2011, there were 36 separate iNO events (6% of CTICU admissions; n = 547). Mean ± SD iNO usage per event was 159 ± 177 hours (median: 63 hours; range: 27–661 hours). From January to December 2012, there were 47 separate iNO events (8% of CTICU admissions; n = 554). Mean iNO usage per event was 125 ± 134 hours (median: 72 hours; range: 2–557 hours). Initiation guideline compliance improved from 83% to 86% (P = .9); weaning guideline compliance improved from 17% to 79% (P &lt; .001). Although mean iNO usage per event decreased, there was no significant reduction in utilization of iNO (P = .09).                                         CONCLUSIONS:               Implementation of standardized iNO initiation and weaning guidelines in the CTICU was successful in reducing practice variation supported by increasing guideline compliance. However, decreasing practice variation did not significantly reduce iNO utilization and does not necessarily reduce cost.","2014-06-01","2025-05-21 21:13:05","2025-05-21 21:13:05","2025-05-21 21:13:05","e1753-e1758","","6","133","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate in pediatric patients the changes of plasma citrulline, arginine, homocysteine and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites and pulmonary artery pressures (PAP) pre-post cardiac surgery in order to describe our population status with regard to the risk of pulmonary hypertension and look for potential biomarkers for early detection and treatment.  Main results/Discussion: 16 Argentine pediatric patients with CHD undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass were randomized in two groups: (A) with and (B) without perioperative citrulline supplementation. We found that plasma citrulline median levels before surgery were lower in both groups respect to referential values, probably due to the poor nutritional status of our patients; only group A surpassed post-surgery the minimum recommended level to avoid PH. Furthermore, none of the patients in group A showed mean PAP higher than 20 mmHg, whereas in group B, 67% of the measurements were ≥ than the reference level.  Conclusions: We reaffirm that citrulline supplementation it is effective in reducing postoperative pulmonary hypertension and biomarkers could evidence patient status as a translational medicine application.","2020-12-01","2025-05-21 21:13:15","2025-05-21 21:13:15","2025-05-21 21:13:15","249-253","","4","77","","Rev Fac Cien Med Univ Nac Cordoba","","","","","","","","","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/I7MWFTF2/Silvera Ruiz et al. - 2020 - Efficacy of citrulline supplementation to decrease the risk of pulmonary hypertension after congenit.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NO is a cellular signaling molecule that induces smooth muscle relaxation in the mammalian vasculature. Inhaled NO has the unique ability to exert its vasodilatory effects in the pulmonary vasculature without any hypotensive side-effects in the systemic circulation. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, NO has been reported in numerous studies to exert beneficial effects on acutely lowering pulmonary artery pressure and reversing right ventricular dysfunction and/or failure. Yet, various investigations failed to demonstrate significant differences in long-term clinical outcomes. The authors, serving as an advisory board of international experts in the field of inhaled NO within pediatric and adult cardiac surgery, will discuss how the existing scientific evidence can be further improved. We will summarize the basic mechanisms underlying the clinical applications of inhaled NO and how this translates into the mandate for inhaled NO in cardiac surgery. We will move on to the popular use of inhaled NO and will talk about the evidence base of the use of this selective pulmonary vasodilator. This review will elucidate what kind of clinical and biological barriers and gaps in knowledge need to be solved and how this has impacted in the development of clinical trials. The authors will elaborate on how the optimization of inhaled NO therapy, the development of biomarkers to identify the target population and the definition of response can improve the design of future large clinical trials. We will explain why it is mandatory to gain an international consensus for the state of the art of NO therapy far beyond this expert advisory board by including the different major players in the field, such as the different medical societies and the pharma industry to improve our understanding of the real-life effects of inhaled NO in large scale observational studies. The design for future innovative randomized controlled trials on inhaled NO therapy in cardiac surgery, adequately powered and based on enhanced biological phenotyping, will be crucial to eventually provide scientific evidence of its clinical efficacy beyond its beneficial hemodynamic properties.","2024-04-05","2025-05-21 21:13:40","2025-05-21 21:13:40","2025-05-21 21:13:40","1374635","","","11","","Front.

Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by deficient nitric oxide synthesis, is implicated in the pathogenesis of various neonatal conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) associated pulmonary hypertension (PH). This review summarizes the current evidence around the possible role of L-CIT supplementation in the treatment of these conditions. Detoxification of endogenously produced superoxide radicals is inadequate in preterm infants due to immature antioxidants that leads to the production of peroxynitrite, a reactive oxygen-free radical that is cytotoxic and causes damage to organelles and cellular membranes, further disrupting the coupling of endothelial NO synthase enzyme and the generation of high levels of reactive nitrogen and oxygen species. Animal studies in lipopolysaccharide-induced models of chorioamnionitis and hyperoxia- and inflammation-induced BPD-PH in rodent lung models revealed that L-CIT supplementation significantly mitigated structural changes in the pulmonary vasculature, preserved alveolar growth, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor gene expression, highlighting the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of L-CIT supplementation. Similar benefits were noted in newborn piglet models of chronic hypoxia-induced PH and NEC. Pharmacokinetic studies in neonates have shown doses of 100–300 mg/kg/day to be safe and well tolerated. A few studies have shown the beneficial effects of L-CIT supplementation in pulmonary hypertension secondary to congenital heart disease, but evidence of efficacy in the neonatal population is lacking. While L-CIT shows promise in the treatment of various neonatal conditions, adequately powered studies to evaluate the safety and efficacy of L-CIT supplementation post-surgical NEC and BPD ± PH in the extremely preterm population are needed to translate this novel therapy to clinical practice.","2024-12-30","2025-05-21 21:13:52","2025-05-21 21:13:52","2025-05-21 21:13:52","42","","1","12","","Children","L-Citrulline in Neonates","","","","","","","en","https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/8SMKTJ7Q/Mascarenhas et al. - 2024 - L-Citrulline in Neonates From Bench to Bed Side.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If left untreated, increased pulmonary resistance develop to pulmonary hypertension (PH) which results in a progressive decrease in right ventricular function, causing right heart failure and death. Although ASD surgical closure is not a complicated procedure, patients with complication of PH and right heart failure have a high mortality rate if not managed properly.

STUDY: A prospective case series report. SETTING: A multidisciplinary pediatric intensive care unit in a University hospital PATIENTS: From June 1993 to March 1996 37 pediatric patients after open heart surgery were treated with inhaled NO. Their mean age was 2.9+/-0.6 years, their mean body weight 12.6+/-1.8 kg. METHODS: Inhaled NO was applied using a microprocessor controlled delivery system which continuously measured NO and NO2 by the chemilumniscence method. Monitoring included ECG, continuous pulse oximetry (SaO2), arterial (AP), central venous (CVP) and left atrial (LAP) pressures and in 8 patients a pulmonary artery (PAP) pressure. Inhaled NO was started at an SaO2 <90% with a fraction of inspired oxygen concentration (FiO2) >0.7, at a mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) >50% of the mean arterial pressure (MAP), and in patients after Fontan-procedure at a CVP-LAP pressure gradient >10 mmHg. RESULTS: The mean dose of inhaled NO was 3.7+/-0.3 ppm and the mean duration was 112+/-14.7 hours. For the whole group SaO2 increased from 79.6+/-2.3 to 90.1+/-1.5% (p<0.01) within 20 minutes of NO-inhalation. Inhaled NO significantly decreased the MPAP from 47.8+/-4 to 27.5+/-2.3 mmHg (p<0.01) in 8 patients with postoperative pulmonary hypertension and significantly decreased the transpulmonary pressure (CVP-LAP) from 14.3+/-0.8 to 7.3+/-0.9 mmHg (p<0.01) in 16 patients after Glenn- or Fontan-procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Inhaled NO is very effective to decrease pulmonary artery pressure, to improve oxygenation, and to improve Fontan-circulation in infants and children after open heart surgery.","1998-02","2025-05-22 13:01:56","2025-05-22 13:02:23","","79-86","","1","39","","J Cardiovasc Surg (Torino)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 9537540","<p>Cited By :12</p>","; /home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/UH8HZAWX/display.html","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9537540","","Female; Humans; Male; Fontan procedure; Heart Defects, Congenital; Nitric oxide; Child; Child, Preschool; Fontan Procedure; Prospective Studies; Nitric Oxide; Postoperative Complications; Vasodilator Agents; Administration, Inhalation; Hypoxia; Hypoxemia; Pulmonary Circulation; Postoperative Care; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Hypertension, pulmonary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Source de données : Références obtenues dans la banque de données Medline®, les revues générales récentes, la bibliothèque du service et les documents personnels. Sélection des travaux : L’ensemble des catégories d’articles sur le thème a été retenu. Extraction des données : Les articles ont été analysés pour l’historique, la biochimie, la pharmacologie, la toxicité et l’utilisation clinique du NOi. Synthèse des données : En 1987, le monoxyde d’azote (NO) est identifié comme un puissant vasodilatateur endothélium-dépendant. Ses effets spécifiques sur la circulation pulmonaire lorsqu’il est administré sous forme inhalé, son absence d’effet sur la circulation systémique puisqu’il est rapidement inactivé par l’hémoglobine, font du NO inhalé (NOi) un agent thérapeutique potentiel dans le contexte de l’hypertension artérielle pulmonaire (HTAP). Lors de la transplantation cardiaque ou de la correction chirurgicale d’une cardiopathie congénitale, le NOi a permis de diminuer l’HTAP et d’améliorer la fonction ventriculaire droite défaillante. Dans cette indication les études ont été réalisées sur de faibles collectifs de patients. Après transplantation pulmonaire, le NOi diminue l’HTAP secondaire au syndrome de reperfusion, mais ne modifie pas la durée de ventilation mécanique ou la mortalité. Dans le syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë, de nombreuses études pharmacologiques préliminaires ont montré son efficacité à diminuer l’HTAP et à améliorer l’oxygénation artérielle. À ce jour, aucune des trois études muticentriques réalisées n’a permis de mettre en évidence une influence significative du NOi sur la durée de ventilation mécanique, la morbidité ou la mortalité. La meilleure indication du NOi revient à l’HTAP persistante du nouveau-né. Deux études multicentriques ont montré une amélioration de l’oxygénation artérielle avec diminution du recours à l’oxygénation extracorporelle. La mortalité globale demeurait cependant inchangée dans ces deux études. Conclusion : L’HTAP réfractaire du nouveau-né reste la seule indication démontrée du NOi. Il doit rester une thérapeutique de sauvetage ou entrant dans le cadre de protocoles dans les autres causes d’hypoxémie réfractaire. Le NOi semble avoir le plus d’intérêt dans le cadre de l’HTAP, l’insuffisance ventriculaire droite et l’hypoxémie sévère. Objective: To analyse the current knowledge concerning use of inhaled NO (iNO) in anaesthesia and intensive care. Data source: References were obtained from Medline®, recent review articles, the library of the department and personal files. Study selection: All categories of articles on this topic have been selected. Data extraction: Articles have been analysed for history, biochemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and clinical use of iNO. Data synthesis: Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endothelium-dependent vasodilator. Because of its selective action on pulmonary circulation and the lack of effect on the systemic circulation due to its inactivation by haemoglobin, iNO has been presented as a new therapeutic agent in most diseases with pulmonary hypertension. During heart transplantation or surgical correction of congenital heart disease, iNO decreases pulmonary hypertension and improves altered right ventricular function. Studies included however small numbers of patients. Preliminary pharmacological studies demonstrated that iNO was able to decrease pulmonary hypertension and improve systemic oxygenation in adult respiratory distress syndrome. To date, none of the three multicentric studies performed was able to show any significant effect on duration of mechanical ventilation, morbidity or mortality. Finally, the sole demonstrated indication for iNO which remains is the persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn. Two multicentric studies have evidenced an improvement in systemic oxygenation and a reduced need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In these two studies global mortality was however unchanged. Conclusion: Persistent pulmonary hypertension is the sole demonstrated indication for iNO. Inhaled nitric oxide may be efficient in pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular dysfunction and severe hypoxemia. Inhaled nitric oxide must be considered as a rescue therapy or needs to be part of research protocols.","2002-07-01","2025-05-21 21:08:51","2025-05-22 13:06:22","2025-05-22 13:05:28","581-590","","7","21","","Annales Françaises d'Anesthésie et de Réanimation","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/4WXUVTZK/Robin et al. - 2002 - Le monoxyde d’azote inhalé en période périopératoire et en réanimation.pdf; /home/fgsj/Zotero/storage/RBX86ZKG/S0750765802006779.html","","","nitric oxide; NO; ARDS; cardiopulmonary bypass; cardiac surgery; pulmonary hypertension; chirurgie cardiaque; circulation extracorporelle; heart transplantation; hypertension artérielle pulmonaire; hypoxaemia; hypoxémie; inhaled NO; monoxyde d’azote; neonate; NO inhalé; nouveau-né; syndrome de détresse respiratoire aiguë; transplantation cardiaque","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

METHODS: A retrospective case-note review of neonatal ECMO and cardiac admissions to a single, tertiary ECMO and cardiac intensive care unit (ICU) between March 1999 and February 2002. RESULTS: 287 symptomatic neonates presented to the ICU with previously undiagnosed cardiac or respiratory disease. Eighty-two with presumed respiratory failure were referred for ECMO, and 205 with suspected CHD were referred for cardiac evaluation. Eight (10%) ECMO referrals, all with presumed persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), were found to have CHD (transposition: 3; total anomalous pulmonary venous connection: 3; left heart obstructive lesions: 2). Mortality in this group was 50%, compared with 11% for correctly identified CHD patients (odds ratio 8.2, 95% CI 1.92, 35.4, p<0.01). For all neonates with CHD, the risk of death was increased by the presence of cardiovascular collapse and end-organ dysfunction at presentation to the ICU (p<0.01 for both). CONCLUSION: Neonates with CHD may present as severe ""PPHN"" via the ECMO service. Poor outcome in these patients relates to the high incidence of cardiovascular collapse and end-organ dysfunction. Early echocardiography is recommended for neonates with presumed PPHN. Neonatal ECMO support should be based in centres with cardiac surgical services.","2005-09","2025-05-22 13:10:14","2025-05-22 13:10:14","","1280-1284","","9","94","","Acta Paediatr","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 16278994","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16278994","","Female; Humans; Male; Retrospective Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Treatment Outcome; Infant, Newborn; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Critical Care; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Respiratory Insufficiency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Part II: diagnosis and treatment","Archives De Pediatrie: Organe Officiel De La Societe Francaise De Pediatrie","","1769-664X","10.1016/j.arcped.2010.11.001","","In pediatric and neonate intensive care units, the most common causes of pulmonary hypertension (PHT) are congenital cardiac malformations, whether operated or not, respiratory diseases leading to acute or chronic hypoxemia, and left heart failure. In children and neonates, ultrasound is now the reference exam to detect and/or diagnose a PHT. Most often, the changes in morphology of the right ventricle and/or septal kinetics provide the diagnosis; the presence of valvular regurgitation (tricuspid, pulmonary) as well as cardiac or extrapulmonary shunts enables quantifying pulmonary arterial pressures with the Doppler flow. Monitoring the factors favoring PHT (hypoxemia, acidosis, hypercapnia, stress, etc.), oxygenation, ventilation, and systemic hemodynamics is crucial before planning specific treatment. Nitric oxide is the first treatment attempted in the ICU; other treatments (prostacyclin, sildenafil, bosentan) can be used in severe PHT, but cautiously because their usefulness in children has only been suggested in small case series.","2011-02","2025-05-22 13:13:04","2025-05-22 13:13:18","","195-203","","2","18","","Arch Pediatr","[Pulmonary hypertension in pediatric and neonatal intensive care unit.

Neonatal repair of IAA is required to avoid irreversible pulmonary vascular lesion. However, in China, patients with IAA associated with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) over one year of age are common. So we investigated the outcome of surgical treatment of IAA with VSD and PDA in patients over one year of age. METHODS: From January 2009 to December 2012, 19 patients with IAA have undergone complete single-stage repair. The patients' mean age was 4.4 years, ranging 1 to 15 years; and their mean weight was 12.8 kg, ranging 4.2 to 36.0 kg. Fifteen IAA were type A, four were type B. Preoperative cardiac catheterization data were available from all patients. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) were measured. The measurements of postoperative pulmonary artery pressure were taken in the operating room at the end of the case. All patients underwent echocardiographic examinations before discharged from the hospital. In addition, cardiac catheterization and echocardiographic examinations were performed during follow-up. Selective brain perfusion through the innominate artery during aortic arch reconstruction was used in all patients. Mean follow-up was (1.6±0.8) years. RESULTS: There were two hospital deaths (2/19, 11%). One patient died of pulmonary hypertension crisis, and another died of postoperative low cardiac output. Five cases had other main postoperative complications but no postoperative neurologic complications. Seventeen survivors were followed up, and there were no late deaths or reoperation. Mean cross-clamp duration was (85±22) minutes and selective brain perfusion duration was (34±11) minutes. Two patients required delayed sternal closure at two days postoperatively. Intensive care unit and hospital stays were (9±8) days and (47±24) days, respectively. Pressure gradients across the anastomosis at most recent follow up were less than 22 mmHg. mPAP regressed significantly from preoperative (62.1±8.1) mmHg to postoperative (37.3±11.3) mmHg (P < 0.001) and (24.2±6.0) mmHg at six months after discharged from the hospital (P < 0.001). The pulmonary vascular resistance also regressed significantly from preoperative (1 501.4±335.7) dyn×s×cm(-5) to (485.0±215.1) dyn×s×cm(-5) at six months after discharged from the hospital (P < 0.001). The majority of the seventeen patients (89%) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I, and 11% remained in NYHA class II. CONCLUSIONS: Single-stage repair of patients with IAA, VSD and PDA over one year of age can have good surgical results and functional outcomes. Assessment and treatment of pulmonary artery pressure pre-operatively and postoperatively was crucial. mPAP and pulmonary vascular resistance may have regress significantly compared to preoperative values.","2014","2025-05-22 13:14:27","2025-05-22 13:14:27","","1684-1690","","9","127","","Chin Med J (Engl)","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24791875","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24791875","","Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Infant; Heart Septal Defects, Ventricular; Vascular Resistance; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Ductus Arteriosus, Patent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
